# Image Storage Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the ability to save images in the database, linked to RequestLog entries, for studying image endpoint performance.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Model (`usage/models.py`)
- **RequestImage Model**: Stores image data with the following fields:
  - `image_data`: Binary field for raw image bytes
  - `mime_type`: Content type of the image
  - `file_size`: Size in bytes
  - `image_hash`: SHA256 hash for deduplication
  - `width` & `height`: Image dimensions (extracted if possible)
  - One-to-one relationship with RequestLog

### 2. Configuration (`config/settings.py`)
Added three new environment variables:
- `SAVE_REQUEST_IMAGES`: Enable/disable feature (default: false)
- `MAX_SAVED_IMAGE_SIZE_MB`: Maximum image size to save (default: 10 MB)
- `IMAGE_RETENTION_DAYS`: Days to retain images (default: 30)

### 3. Image Saving Logic (`core/views.py`)
- Modified `SolveView` to save images when `SAVE_REQUEST_IMAGES=true`
- Saves images for both successful and failed requests
- Respects size limits
- Handles errors gracefully (doesn't fail the request if image save fails)

### 4. Admin Interface (`usage/admin.py`)
- Added `RequestImageAdmin` with:
  - Image preview in admin
  - Human-readable file sizes
  - Image dimensions display
  - Search by request ID and image hash
  - Read-only interface (no manual additions)

### 5. Management Command (`usage/management/commands/cleanup_old_images.py`)
- Command to clean up old images based on retention policy
- Supports `--dry-run` mode for safety
- Shows storage freed when cleaning
- Usage: `uv run python manage.py cleanup_old_images --days 30`

### 6. Performance API (`usage/views.py` & `usage/urls.py`)
- New endpoint: `/api/usage/image-performance-stats`
- Admin-only access
- Returns comprehensive statistics:
  - Overall stats (request count, average duration, storage used)
  - Performance by image dimensions
  - Breakdown by MIME type
  - Recent trends (last 7 days)

### 7. Dependencies
- Added `Pillow>=10.0,<11.0` for image dimension extraction

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
1. `usage/models.py` - Added RequestImage model
2. `config/settings.py` - Added configuration variables
3. `core/views.py` - Added image saving logic
4. `usage/admin.py` - Added RequestImage admin
5. `config/urls.py` - Added usage app URLs
6. `pyproject.toml` - Added Pillow dependency

### Created Files:
1. `usage/management/commands/__init__.py`
2. `usage/management/commands/cleanup_old_images.py`
3. `usage/urls.py`
4. `usage/migrations/0003_requestimage.py` (auto-generated)d
5. `docs/IMAGE_STORAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
6. `test_image_storage.py` (test script)

## Testing
All components tested and verified:
- ✅ Model creation and relationships
- ✅ Admin interface registration
- ✅ Management command execution
- ✅ API endpoint routing
- ✅ Database migrations applied

## How to Use

### 1. Enable the Feature
```bash
export SAVE_REQUEST_IMAGES=true
export MAX_SAVED_IMAGE_SIZE_MB=10
export IMAGE_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```

### 2. Run the Server
```bash
uv run python manage.py runserver
```

### 3. Send Image Requests
Images will be automatically saved when requests are made to `/api/core/solve`

### 4. View Saved Images
- Admin interface: `http://localhost:8000/admin/usage/requestimage/`
- Performance stats: `GET /api/usage/image-performance-stats` (admin only)

### 5. Clean Up Old Images
```bash
# Dry run to see what would be deleted
uv run python manage.py cleanup_old_images --dry-run

# Actually delete old images
uv run python manage.py cleanup_old_images --days 30
```

### 6. Set Up Automated Cleanup (Production)
Add to crontab:
```bash
0 2 * * * cd /app && uv run python manage.py cleanup_old_images
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Storage**: Images are stored as binary data in PostgreSQL
2. **Size Limits**: Configurable via `MAX_SAVED_IMAGE_SIZE_MB`
3. **Retention**: Automatic cleanup via management command
4. **Indexing**: Hash field indexed for deduplication queries
5. **Relationship**: One-to-one with RequestLog prevents N+1 queries

## Security Notes

1. **Access Control**: 
   - Only admins can view saved images
   - Performance stats require admin permissions
   
2. **Data Privacy**: 
   - Images contain user-submitted content
   - Consider encryption for sensitive data
   
3. **Resource Limits**: 
   - Size limits prevent abuse
   - Retention policy manages storage growth

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements documented in the implementation plan:
- Image deduplication using hash
- Compression for storage efficiency
- External storage (S3/GCS) for scale
- Analytics dashboard with visualizations
- Image processing metrics by error type

## Conclusion

The feature is fully implemented, tested, and ready for use. It provides valuable data for analyzing image endpoint performance while being mindful of storage and security considerations. The opt-in design ensures it doesn't impact production unless explicitly enabled.
